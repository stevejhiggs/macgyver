# MacGyver

Building a better mullet.

Inspired by mullet.io it's a combination of react on the frontend and hapi.js on the backend. It started as a simple one off client example
but is no growing to encompass a variety of different examples for people to take apart and play with.

# available examples

* simpleComponent - the simplest possible implementation of react. Shows how to get the views built and injected client side.

* raw-flux - shows the integration of react with the flux design architecture and how they compliment each other. - credit to @rtomlinson
* redux - shows how to use the fantastic redux flux implementation
* redux-router - adding routing to redux
* fluxible_fluxible-router - shows a fully isomorphic app using fluxible and the fluxible-router - probably a little easier to follow than the basic flux example
